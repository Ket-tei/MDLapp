
## MDL Application

*Still in dev*

The project is to create a Mobile App to assist the Student Organization of my former high school.

The main feature of the App is to assist in gathering information on the students of the organization (Name, First Name, Phone Number, Email...), modifying them, and deleting them if the student leaves the association. This information will be displayed on the screen. The App will also display the status of the association room (open or closed) and important messages from the organization.

Another feature is to choose at the start whether you are a simple student of the association, a staff member, or an admin of the organization. Depending on that, you will need to enter a password, and you will not have access to every feature.

Because it's just a Student Association, the budget for these development things is non-existent. So the App must utilize only free tools.

Given these constraints, I chose to build the app with React-Native and utilize Google Sheets Online for the Database. It's not the most sophisticated Database and it's not intended for this purpose, but it's free, secure, and easy to use with the Google API.

Regarding Graphic Charts, I didn't have any constraints because the association has none.

These are the different screens of the app for now:
