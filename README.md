# MDL Application

## Overview
MDL Application is a mobile app designed to assist the Student Organization of my former high school. The app facilitates student information management and provides essential updates regarding the organization.

## Features
- **Student Management**: Add, edit, and remove student records (Name, First Name, Phone Number, Email, etc.).
- **Association Room Status**: Display whether the association room is open or closed.
- **Important Announcements**: Show crucial messages from the organization.
- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - Student: Limited access to basic features.
  - Staff: Access to additional management functionalities.
  - Admin: Full access with administrative privileges.
- **Authentication**: Role-based access requires a password.

## Tech Stack
- **React Native**: Chosen for its cross-platform capabilities and ease of use.
- **Google Sheets API**: Serves as a free, secure, and easily manageable database.

## Constraints & Considerations
- **Budget-Free Development**: The app leverages free tools due to the organization's lack of a development budget.
- **No Graphic Chart Constraints**: The organization has no predefined branding guidelines.
